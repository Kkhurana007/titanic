Age ranges from 0 to 80 years with mean and mode around 25-30 years, Fare ranges from 0 to over 500 dollars, Parch and SibSp has its mode at 0 meaning most people did not travel with any parent/child or sibling/spouse, There were around 453 males and 289 females onboard, 424 perished and 288 survived. Most of the passengers were in Lower Pclass and embarked at station S.\n\nUnderstanding the dependencies of dependent and independent variables\nSince for the given data, more than 50% of the passengers perished, We will investigate the factors that survival of the passengers depend on and would like to answer questions like did females have more chance of surviving, how does age or fare affect the survival, does having a parent or child, or sibling or spouse influence survival and how does Pclass affect survival. Dependent variable is ‘Survived’ which gives 0 for rows for passengers who perished and 1 for passengers that survived. Independent variables are Sex, Pclass, Embarked, Age, Fare etc.\nThere could be other factors or variables like location of cabins or location/state(sleep or awake) of passengers at the time of the accident etc which we had limited data for and hence ave been omitted from the analysis. We also omitted rows that had missing values for ‘Age’ and ‘Embarked’ so that will also skew the statistical analysis a bit.\n\n#Function to create grouped data by factors\ndef grouped_by_factors(df,factor):\n    mean_by_factor = df.groupby(factor).describe()\n    return mean_by_factor\n\nSome understanding of mean/max/std/count would be helpful for our analysis so I created a function to display statistics using groupby function.

On average, passengers who survived paid higher fare(mean=51.6 dollars) as compared to who did not(mean=22.9 dollars).\nFrom the barchart, the survival rate for those travelling with 1/2 sibling or spouse and 1/2/3 parent or children was higher than the ones that did not. The relationship of survival is not linear with the number of sibsp/parch which could be due to lack of data.\nFrom the correlation plot, Survival rate is positively correlated to Fare and negatively correlated to Age which means younger people and those who paid more had higher chances of surviving\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Dependent variable ‘Survived’ by Categorical columns\n\n‘Survived’ by Pclass\n\ngrouped_by_factors(data,'Pclass')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAge\nFare\nParch\nSibSp\nSurvived\n\n\nPclass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLower\ncount\n355.000000\n355.000000\n355.000000\n355.000000\n355.000000\n\n\nmean\n25.140620\n13.229435\n0.456338\n0.585915\n0.239437\n\n\nstd\n12.495398\n10.043158\n0.971447\n1.157303\n0.427342\n\n\nmin\n0.420000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n25%\n18.000000\n7.775000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n50%\n24.000000\n8.050000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n75%\n32.000000\n15.741700\n1.000000\n1.000000\n0.000000\n\n\nmax\n74.000000\n56.495800\n6.000000\n5.000000\n1.000000\n\n\nMiddle\ncount\n173.000000\n173.000000\n173.000000\n173.000000\n173.000000\n\n\nmean\n29.877630\n21.471556\n0.404624\n0.427746\n0.479769\n\n\nstd\n14.001077\n13.187429\n0.705775\n0.611645\n0.501041\n\n\nmin\n0.670000\n10.500000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n25%\n23.000000\n13.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n50%\n29.000000\n15.045800\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n75%\n36.000000\n26.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n\n\nmax\n70.000000\n73.500000\n3.000000\n3.000000\n1.000000\n\n\nUpper\ncount\n184.000000\n184.000000\n184.000000\n184.000000\n184.000000\n\n\nmean\n38.105543\n88.048121\n0.413043\n0.456522\n0.652174\n\n\nstd\n14.778904\n81.293524\n0.734061\n0.634406\n0.477580\n\n\nmin\n0.920000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n25%\n27.000000\n33.890600\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n50%\n37.000000\n67.950000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n1.000000\n\n\n75%\n49.000000\n107.043750\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n\n\nmax\n80.000000\n512.329200\n4.000000\n3.000000\n1.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize =(12,3))\nfig1 = sns.countplot(x=\"Pclass\", data=data, hue='Survived', palette=\"Greens_d\", ax=ax1);\nplt.legend([\"Perished\", \"Survived\"])\nfig2 = sns.barplot(x=\"Pclass\", y=\"Survived\", data=data, ax=ax2);\nplt.suptitle(\"Survival rate by Pclass\", size=12)\n\n&lt;matplotlib.text.Text&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nMean Fare of Upper Class was 88 dollars, Middle Class was 21.47 dollars and Lower Class was 13.22 dollars.

The reason why I am picking them is because they show correlation with survival rate. Survival showed correlation to Fare as well but since the fare is represented by Pclass, I picked Pclass over Fare. Although other factors also affect survival, but I will focus on these three for this exercise\n\n\n\nUnderstanding Pclass and Sex as a factor\n\nsns.barplot(x=\"Pclass\", y=\"Survived\", hue=\"Sex\", data=data);\nplt.suptitle(\"Mean Survival rate of Female vs Male survivors by Pclass\", size=12)\n\n&lt;matplotlib.text.Text&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were 314 females and 577 males, mean for female survivors(mean=0.74,std= 0.44) is more than males(mean=0.19,std= 0.39) across all Pclasses, Survival has linear relationship with class. Females had high probability of survival in both Upper and Middle class. Only upper class males had high probability of survival, which was lower than low class female passengers however\n\n\nUnderstanding Age as a factor\n\nprint(grouped_by_factors(data,'Age').head())\nprint(grouped_by_factors(data,'Age').tail())\n\n              Fare  Parch  SibSp  Survived\nAge                                       \n0.42 count  1.0000    1.0    1.0       1.0\n     mean   8.5167    1.0    0.0       1.0\n     std       NaN    NaN    NaN       NaN\n     min    8.5167    1.0    0.0       1.0\n     25%    8.5167    1.0    0.0       1.0\n          Fare  Parch  SibSp  Survived\nAge                                   \n80.0 min  30.0    0.0    0.0       1.0\n     25%  30.0    0.0    0.0       1.0\n     50%  30.0    0.0    0.0       1.0\n     75%  30.0    0.0    0.0       1.0\n     max  30.0    0.0    0.0       1.0\n\n\n\nsurv_age = data[data['Survived'] == 1]\ng = surv_age['Age'].plot(kind='hist', figsize=[12,6], alpha=.8)\nnotsurv_age = data[data['Survived'] == 0]\nnotsurv_age['Age'].plot(kind='hist', figsize=[12,6], alpha=.4)\nplt.legend(label)\ng.set(xlabel='Age')\nplt.suptitle(\"Distribution of Age for Perished and Survived\", size=12)\n\n&lt;matplotlib.text.Text&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nAge of the passengers ranged from 0 to 80 years. Green bar is for passengers who did not survive and the blue is for those who survived. The distribution is almost normal distribution with similar shape and mode around 20 years. Below is the correlation for Age vs mean survived, it shows slight negative correlation with pearson’r value of -0.082\n\nCorrelation of ‘Survived’ with Age\n\nsns.set(style=\"darkgrid\", color_codes=True)\ng = sns.jointplot(\"Age\", \"Survived\", data=data, kind=\"reg\",color=\"g\", size=7)\nplt.subplots_adjust(top=0.95)\nplt.suptitle(\"Distribution of Age for Perished and Survived\", size=12)\n\n&lt;matplotlib.text.Text&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation of ‘Survived’ with Age and Sex\n\ng = sns.lmplot(x=\"Age\", y=\"Survived\", col=\"Sex\", hue=\"Sex\", data=data, y_jitter=.02, logistic=True)\nplt.subplots_adjust(top=0.9)\nplt.suptitle(\"Correlation of Age with Survival Rate\", size=12)\n\n&lt;matplotlib.text.Text&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvival probability was higher for Younger Men and Older Women, Side by side comparison of males and females by age further supports that\n\ng = sns.factorplot(x=\"Survived\", y=\"Age\", hue=\"Sex\", data=data, size=6, kind=\"bar\", palette=\"muted\")\ng.despine(left=True)\nplt.subplots_adjust(top=0.95)\nplt.suptitle(\"Survived vs Age for males and females\", size=12)\ng.set_xticklabels(['Perished', 'Survived'])"

    "text": "Conclusions\nIn Conclusion with the given dataset, Most contributing factors are ‘Sex’ and Pclass. Women had the most probability of survival in general. Survival rate is positively correlated to Fare and negatively correlated to Age which means younger people and those who paid more had higher chances of surviving. Females had positive correlation of survival with age and Males had negative correlation. Most survivors were from Upper Pclass followed by medium and lower class passengers. Most of the passengers in lower class perished. Passengers with any parent/child/sibling or spouse had higher chance at survival than the ones that did not. The analysis has following limitations: Omitted rows with missing values for ‘Age’ and ‘emabarked’ Did not draw conclusions based on ‘Name’ column dropped ‘Cabin’ and ‘PassengerId’ during data wrangling phase The data set is limited, the complete dataset should contain data for 1500 passengers"
